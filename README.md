jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript.

In this repository, I have showcased some of the capabilities of jQuery in a few cool little apps. Although very few lines of jQuery are typically being written, the apps actually have fairly rich interfaces. No wonder why jQuery is referred to as the 'write less, do more' library.
